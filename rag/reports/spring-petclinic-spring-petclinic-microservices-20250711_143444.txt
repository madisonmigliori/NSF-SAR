--- Refactored Architecture Plan ---
 Here is a simplified ASCII tree diagram representation of the refactored microservices architecture based on the provided directory structure and dependency information. Please note that this is a high-level view and actual implementation might require further detailing:

```
spring-petclinic-microservices
├── config
│   └── config-server (Spring Cloud Config Server)
├── gateway
│   └── api-gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway)
├── bus
│   └── event-bus (Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ)
├── discovery
│   ├── eureka-server (Eureka Discovery Server)
│   └── consul-server (Consul Discovery Server if needed)
├── modules
│   ├── user-service
│   ├── payment-service
│   ├── order-service
│   └── ... (add more services based on your needs)
└── ui
    └── web-ui
```

1. API Gateway: The gateway service will be responsible for handling incoming requests, routing them to the appropriate microservices, and providing a single entry point for external clients. It will be placed under the 'gateway' directory.

2. Config Server: Configuration data will be centralized in the Spring Cloud Config Server located under the 'config' directory. This will enable easy management of configuration settings across all microservices.

3. Event Bus (Kafka or RabbitMQ): If needed, you can add an event bus to handle asynchronous communication between microservices. It will be placed in the 'bus' directory.

4. Discovery Server: Services will register themselves with either Eureka or Consul for service discovery purposes. The servers should be located under the 'discovery' directory.

5. Logical Grouping: Services have been grouped based on their functionality (e.g., user, payment, order). This makes it easier to manage and maintain each service individually.

6. Event Producers/Consumers: Identify which services produce or consume events in the event bus to ensure proper communication between them.

7. Modularity: Each microservice will be developed as an independent module with its own repository, dependencies, and tests. This promotes modularity and encourages loose coupling between services.

8. Config Centralization: Placing the Config Server at the root level allows for easy management of configuration settings across all microservices from a single location.

9. Fault Tolerance: The use of Circuit Breakers, Resilience4J, and Chaos Monkey ensures that individual service failures do not affect the overall system's availability. Additionally, monitoring tools like Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, Zipkin, and Jolokia help in identifying issues early on and improving fault tolerance.

By refactoring the codebase into this microservices architecture, we can achieve improved maintainability and scalability as each service will be responsible for a specific functionality and can be scaled independently based on demand. Additionally, the centralization of configuration settings and event-driven communication between services makes it easier to manage and extend the system in the future.
