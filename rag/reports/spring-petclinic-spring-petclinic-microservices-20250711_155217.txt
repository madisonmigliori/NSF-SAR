--- Refactored Architecture Plan ---
 Based on your provided dependencies, let's refactor the given monolithic or loosely-coupled codebase into a robust microservices architecture using the Spring Cloud ecosystem. Here is an ASCII tree diagram of the proposed structure:

```
spring-petclinic-microservices
├── api-gateway
│   ├── config
│   ├── src
│   └── ...
├── config-server
│   ├── src
│   └── ...
├── event-bus (Kafka/RabbitMQ)
│   ├── src
│   └── ...
├── discovery-server (Eureka/Consul if applicable)
│   ├── src
│   └── ...
├── services
│   ├── user-service
│   ├── payment-service
│   ├── order-service
│   └── ...
│       ├── config
│       ├── src
│       └── ...
```

1. Grouped services logically (users, payments, orders) and added new components:
   - API Gateway: `api-gateway` will act as an entry point for all client requests, route them to the appropriate microservice and provide rate limiting, caching, and authentication mechanisms if necessary.
   - Config Server: `config-server` provides a centralized location to manage application configuration properties, allowing easy management of environments (dev, test, prod).
   - Event Bus (Kafka/RabbitMQ): The event bus is added as the `event-bus` module for decoupling services through events. This will improve communication and resilience between microservices.
   - Discovery Server: If you are using Eureka, create a separate `discovery-server` module to register and discover instances of your microservices.

2. Introduced and placed the API Gateway, Config Server, Event Bus (Kafka/RabbitMQ), and Discovery Server in their respective directories. The gateway, bus, and config server will have dependencies on common modules such as Actuator and Observability for monitoring purposes.

3. Optimized modularity by separating concerns into distinct microservices, reducing the complexity of the monolithic application and improving maintainability. Configured centralization of configuration through the Config Server improves flexibility and reduces errors. Fault tolerance is achieved using Resilience4J circuit breakers and Chaos Monkey for testing and production environments.

Here's a brief explanation:
- The new structure separates the application into distinct microservices based on functionalities like users, payments, and orders. Each service will have its configuration, allowing easy management of properties in different environments.
- The API Gateway is placed at the root level, acting as an entry point for client requests. It routes them to the appropriate microservice while providing additional features such as caching, rate limiting, and authentication if necessary.
- Config Server is added to provide centralized management of configuration properties for all microservices in different environments (dev, test, prod). This improves maintainability by reducing errors associated with manually managing configuration files across services.
- Event Bus (Kafka/RabbitMQ) is used to decouple services through events and improve communication resilience between them.
- By introducing Discovery Server (Eureka/Consul if applicable), microservices can register themselves, making it easier for clients to discover instances running in the cluster.
- The new structure improves maintainability by reducing the complexity of the monolithic application and improving modularity, config centralization, and fault tolerance. This allows teams to work independently on each service and reduces the risk of downtime due to issues affecting a single microservice.
